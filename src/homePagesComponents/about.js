        <strong>"Our Story, Our Journey”</strong> Scrum Peer was born from a
        simple realization — students struggle when learning alone, and tutors
        struggle to reach those who need them most. In classrooms, learning
        often feels one-directional — teachers teach, students listen, and
        doubts remain unanswered. Traditional tutoring adds cost, distance, and
        delay. We wanted to fix that. So, we created Scrum Peer — a peer-to-peer
        learning platform that empowers students to seek help instantly and
        tutors to teach flexibly, creating a dynamic cycle of learning,
        teaching, and growth.

      <p className="about-heading">🚀 Our Vision</p>
      <p>To make education accessible, interactive, and human-centered.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Every learner can find the right mentor in moments.</li>
        <li>
          We envision a world where: Every educator can share knowledge freely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Learning becomes continuous — not limited by time, geography, or
          money.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="about-heading">🌱 Our Philosophy</p>
      <p>We believe in three pillars:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Connection:</strong> True learning happens when minds connect
          and collaborate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Empowerment:</strong> Students should feel confident to ask,
          explore, and grow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community:</strong> A space where learning and teaching fuel
          each other’s progress.
        </li>
      </ul>
